# Depot Utility

The Depot Utility is a program designed to automate and optimize the process of submitting warranty requests to Dell through Dell Tech Direct. 

The Depot Utility uses the Java 8 Software Development Kit, JavaFX, Selenium Webdriver, JFoenix, CSS, Chromdriver and SQL Server Express.

Features of the Warranty Utility include:
  - Allows the user to store multiple Warranty Machines to have warranty requests submitted for
  - Allows the user to remove warranty machines in singles or multiples if a mistake is made
  - Allows the user to view a log containing all machines that have been warrantied through use of the application
  - Allows the user to view a pie graph of log information that sorts by the part that was received or the model of machine

The Service Now tab is newly added and is designed to allow a user to automatically close a list of tickets through Service Now as well as entering tracking numbers and work notes.
